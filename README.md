# Silvertip

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/valotrading/silvertip.png)](http://travis-ci.org/valotrading/silvertip)

Silvertip is a networking library, which aims to be easy to use, while hiding
the complexities of the Java NIO API. While similar libraries exist, they are
either hard to use, discontinued, or part of a bigger application framework
that offer an API for using different transports.

## Download

Add a dependency to Silvertip:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>silvertip</groupId>
      <artifactId>silvertip</artifactId>
      <version><!-- (latest version) --></version>
    </dependency>

Because Silvertip is not available in the Central Repository, you need to add
Silvertip's repository as well:

    <repository>
      <id>valotrading</id>
      <url>http://valotrading.github.io/maven</url>
    </repository>
