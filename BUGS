- Idle time is not accounted properly if selector is woken up spuriously or if
  someone calls selector.wakeup().

- Partial writes are not handled at all which may result in corrupted data

- OP_WRITE is not handled:

  "Not handling the OP_WRITE correctly can make your server performance pretty
   bad, and on win32, can produce disastrous performance problem, like freezing
   the OS by eating all the CPU."
