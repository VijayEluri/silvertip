- Idle time is not accounted properly if selector is woken up spuriously or if
  someone calls selector.wakeup().

- OP_WRITE is not handled:

  "Not handling the OP_WRITE correctly can make your server performance pretty
   bad, and on win32, can produce disastrous performance problem, like freezing
   the OS by eating all the CPU."

   See http://bit.ly/aCPE2f for details.

- FIX message payload encoding is not handled at all which might corrupt data.
